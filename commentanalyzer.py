# This program checks on the code when it is merged into the build pipeline. This program runs everytime an engineer checks in code.
# 
# 

# 1.) When a file is checked in, scan file to count total number of lines

# 2.) Scan file to identify comments, and count total lines of comments in the file.

# 3.) After identifying lines of comments, scan to seggregate total number of single line comments and the total number of multi-line comments

# 4.) Any line of code with both code and a comment should count both as a line of code and also a comment line


# 5.) From all the comments, identify the total number of TODOS


# NOTE:
# 	1.) Ignore files starting with '.'
# 	2.) We can check any valid program
# 	3.) If a file has no extension, then ignore it.
# 	
# 	Input: file name
# 	Output:
# Example:
# Total # of lines: 60
# Total # of comment lines: 28
# Total # of single line comments: 6
# Total # of comment lines within block comments: 22
# Total # of block line comments: 2
# Total # of TODOâ€™s: 1
# 



# New style object for backwards compatibility with Python 2 and Python 3. We are being Python agnostic.

# OOP Approach: Same maintainability as Procedural approach
# but uses much more memory: Analyzed at
# 1235% more on average.

# Determine Language group by looking at file extensions

#Circumstances for c style comments:
#"Inlines:"
#// single line comment taking up line solely
